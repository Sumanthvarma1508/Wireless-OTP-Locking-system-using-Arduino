# Wireless-OTP-Locking-system-using-Arduino
OTP based smart Lock- Our goal is to design a solution for secure access control that can replace physical keys for accessing door. We propose a solution using OTP based on smart phones providing wireless and automatic unlocking via Bluetooth .
The design will allow easy implementation and the device will work autonomously.This will enhance the security and will eliminate the need of carrying physical keys.
